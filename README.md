##Introduction

Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia is a home to about over 7 million people and is split into more than 40 districts. Each neighborhood has its own features and characteristics. Some are popular for parks and tourist attractions, while others are dense urban neighborhoods with office buildings and skyscrapers. There are neighborhoods mostly populated with local Chinese people, and places with large expat community. There are industrial neighborhoods with houses for low income foreign labour, and areas such as Damansara Heights, the home of celebrities, politicians and rich people in general.

In this project we will compare different neighborhoods of the KL city based on property prices, types and venues around that neighborhood using machine learning clustering algorithms.
